• Developed an interactive interface allowing resolution selection and dynamic threshold adjustments via a trackbar
mechanism by integrating Logitech C2xx with Raspberry Pi, harnessing OpenCV's VideoCapture for dynamic frame acquisition.
• Deployed a suite of image transformation algorithms—Canny Edge Detection, Hough Line Transformation, and Hough Circle
Transformation. User selections trigger tailored filtering and processing on video frames in real-time.
• Utilized precise frame timestamping and SCHED_FIFO scheduling to monitor and optimize processing durations, while
assessing execution times against obtained deadlines to ensure reliable performance under real-time constraints.
